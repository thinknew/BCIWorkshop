# BCI Workshop

This repository is part of the hands-on workshop on how to bridge the gap between Neuroscience and Computational Intelligence to design and develop Brain-Computer Interface. This workshop intends to promote standardization of terminologies and technologies for Brain-Computer Interfaces to computational intelligence practitioners and Neuroscience communities. The workshop promotes the utilization of open-source tools such as Google TensorFlow for enhancing community cohesion and BCI standardization.

What is included in this respository 
==============
* Jupyter Notebook to create and process EEG data with TensorFlow
* Three set of EEG data collected from P300 experiment during the workshop
  * Data is in .mat format and contain two variables Data (Channel X Number of Samples]) and Label (Binary class)

External material used in workshop
==============
* [Matlab based P300 ERP Processing pipeline](//au.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/113645-p300-erp-preprocessing-gui)

Is there recorded videos for workshop
==============
